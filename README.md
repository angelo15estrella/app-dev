# Spider-Man: No Way Home *Spider-Man: No Way Home* is an American superhero movie based on Marvel Comics. It brings Peter Parker to Doctor Strange for a solution to make everyone forget his identity. But things get worse as the spell does not execute by erasing but rather opens the multiverse, causing villains from other dimensions to enter his world.

## Main Characters 
1. **Peter Parker/Spider-Man** - A teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider, dealing with the fallout of his exposed identity and exploring a darker side of the character.
2. **MJ Jones-Watson** - Parker's classmate and girlfriend, whose full name is revealed in the film, bringing her closer to her comic counterpart.
3.  **Dr. Strange** - Neurosurgeon who after sustaining an injury was left incapacitated and now the Master of the Mystic Arts, colleague to Parker not a mentor.
4.  **Ned Leeds** - Parker's best friend, lost 102 pounds for this movie.

## Why I Love It I love Spider-Man: No Way Home because it perfectly balances nostalgia and the newest, interesting storyline. With the concept of the multiverse, such a movie can bring beloved characters together and some of the most iconic villains in one frame and present viewers with hundreds of moments full of suspense and emotions. Tom Holland as Peter Parker is heartful and very convincing in the role, which puts Spider-Man up there as the best among all the other films of its genre.
